# B Ride

A decentralized Ride Sharing Application using Blockchain, that ensures privacy, security and fare payments.

## What is B Ride?

B Ride is a ride Sharing Decentralized Application which is built atop open and permissionless blockchain and provides a platform for users to share their ride with other users with privacy, security and fare payments.

## What it does

B Ride looks to become a decentralized sharing economy platform that combines the growing trend of peer-to-peer businesses with long-distance/inter-city traveling. Through a web application, B Ride connects Riders, those who would like a convenient way of getting from one city to another without driving, with our Drivers who happen to be going along that route and have extra seats in their vehicles. From a business standpoint, a distinct advantage that B Ride has over other solutions lies in its ability to maximize economic efficiency. The platform provides value to customers who now have a reliable and low-cost alternative for traveling, as well as commuters/drivers who are able to cut down or recoup the cost of gas for a journey they were planning on regardless.

**But where does the blockchain and decentralization come into play?**
All data concerning delivery transactions are stored on the Ethereum blockchain network. In a nutshell, Ethereum gives you the power to trust. It enables the development of systems of automated and executable agreements facilitated by smart contracts that ensure that all counterparties are treated fairly throughout a transaction. Decentralization allows us to further maximize economic efficiency by replacing any profit-seeking intermediaries with smart contracts established directly between parties (Rider and Driver). This is unlike services like Uber and Lyft, which take a cut of the payment from the user of the service to the provider to compensate them for facilitating the transaction. We believe this reinforces our mission for creating positive change in a non-profit manner.

In addition, since Ethereum tracks every transaction non-repudiably on the blockchain, there is always a trusted record. This allows for better transparency and more trust between Riders and Drivers in this open development platform. Lastly, with on-chain data concerning the reputation of both Riders and Drivers and the success of their prior "transactions", the use of blockchain technology promises to help facilitate the decentralized credit scoring system of the future.
