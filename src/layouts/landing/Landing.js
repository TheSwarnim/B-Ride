              <p>
                B-Ride enables drivers to offer ride-sharing services without
                relying on a trusted third party. Both riders and drivers can
                learn whether they can share rides while preserving their trip
                data, including pick-up/drop-off location, departure/arrival
                date and travel price.
              </p>
              <p>
                To preserve ridersâ€™ trip privacy, we use cloaking, so a rider
                posts a cloaked pick-up and drop-off location as well as pick-up
                time. Then, interested drivers use off-line matching technique .

                A rider can select the best-matched driver to share a trip based
                on some heuristics , B-Ride computes the reputation of drivers
                based on their prior behaviours. Unlike, current centralized
